# PSMD (Peak width of Skeletonized Mean Diffusivity)

PSMD is a robust, fully-automated and easy-to-implement marker for cerebral small vessel disease based on diffusion tensor imaging, white matter tract skeletonization (as implemented in FSL-TBSS) and histogram analysis.

**For more information on usage, including FAQ, please visit [www.psmd-marker.com](https://www.psmd-marker.com).**


## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER  

PSMD is NOT a medical device and therefore **for research use only**. Do not use PSMD for diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring or any other clinical routine use. Any application in clinical routine is forbidden by law, e.g. by Medical Device Regulation article 5 in the EU.


## Usage

Download one of our [releases](https://github.com/miac-research/psmd/releases). For a new project, take the latest release. It is best practice to stick with one release version throughout a project.  

For even better replicability and traceability, we strongly recommend using a container for the software dependencies, e.g. the **[PSMD container recipe](https://github.com/miac-research/psmd/tree/main/container)** for Apptainer/Singularity.

For more information, please see the project website at [www.psmd-marker.com](https://www.psmd-marker.com) or type `./psmd.sh -h` at the command line.
